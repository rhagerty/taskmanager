# FreeThought Planner - The digital planner made with neurodiversity in mind.

# Introduction

FreeThought Planner is a React application that I developed while enrolled in a software engineering bootcamp (Springboard). There is a dashboard that highlights the day's schedule and priorities, as well as a space to write notes. The user can use the planner (month / week / day) to add, edit or delete events.

The application was created with `create-react-app`, using `styled-components` for the styling and the animations. Events and meetings are stored on a MongoDB database. The technologies used include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, Express, RESTful API, MongoDB. Element interaction was created using InteractJs.

# Project features

The application allows the user to view meetings and events stored from a database.
The key features are:

- A tab-like component to switch between the different views.
- Three different date pickers to switch between months, weeks or days.
- In the day view, ability to edit or delete an event.
- On the homepage, some articles from GoogleNews API are fetched once per day and are displayed in a news feed.
- On the home page, the current weather is shown and is fetched from Weather API on every mount of the page.

The "+" button opens a form in a modal:

- Title, description, location
- Date pickers for the start and end date / all-day option
- Time pickers for the start and end time
